# leaflet-challenge

The goal of the leaflet challenge is to display an interactive map of the world displaying earthquake data from the past 7 days. The earthquake data is in geojson format.

This interactivity included displaying the data as circle shaped markers with the radius being determined by the magnitude of the earthquake. The colour of the marker was also determined by the magnitude as well. A legend displays what the colours mean.

The markers also contained popups when clicked displaying the location, magnitude and date/time of the earthquake. 

Finally, the map also includes different layers including a Street View, Dark View and Satellite View.
